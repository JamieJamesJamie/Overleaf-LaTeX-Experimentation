# Overleaf-LaTeX-Experimentation
I have now used LaTeX for about a year. It's been great! But there are things that I could improve on that I would like to learn about. So I decided to create a git repo and experiment with the documentation provided by Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/learn). Hopefully this helps to teach me more about LaTeX than I knew about before!
